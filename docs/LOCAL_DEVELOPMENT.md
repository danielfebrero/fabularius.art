# Local Development Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the PornSpot.ai application on your local machine. The local environment uses Docker and LocalStack to emulate AWS services, providing a consistent and isolated development experience.

## Overview

The local development setup is designed to be as simple as possible. A single script, `start-local-backend.sh`, automates the entire process of setting up the backend infrastructure, including:

- Starting a LocalStack container with S3 and DynamoDB.
- Initializing the local AWS resources.
- Setting up the database schema.
- Creating a default admin user.
- Starting the backend server.

The frontend is run separately using the standard Next.js development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Docker**: The latest version
- **Docker Compose**: The latest version
- **Git**: The latest version

The `start-local-backend.sh` script will check for these prerequisites and exit if they are not found.

## Quick Start

Getting the application running locally is a two-step process:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pornspot-ai
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Files**:
    Before running any scripts, you must set up your local environment files.

    ```bash
    # For the frontend
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local

    # For the backend
    cp backend/.env.example.json backend/.env.local.json

    # For the scripts
    cp scripts/.env.example scripts/.env.local
    ```

    Now, review the newly created `.local` files and ensure the values are correct for your machine.

3.  **Run the Setup Script**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/start-local-backend.sh
    ./scripts/start-local-backend.sh
    ```

This script will set up the entire backend environment using the variables from your new configuration files. Once it's running, you can proceed to start the frontend.

## The `start-local-backend.sh` Script

The `start-local-backend.sh` script is the heart of the local setup process. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1.  **Starts LocalStack**: It launches a Docker container running LocalStack, which emulates AWS services locally. The services enabled are S3 and DynamoDB.
2.  **Initializes AWS Resources**: It runs the `init-local-aws.sh` script to:
    - Create the `local-pornspot-media` S3 bucket.
    - Apply a CORS policy to the S3 bucket to allow access from the frontend.
3.  **Sets Up the Database**: It executes the `setup-local-db.js` script, which creates the `local-pornspot-media` DynamoDB table with the correct schema.
4.  **Creates an Admin User**: It runs `create-admin.js` to create a default admin user with the username `dani`.
5.  **Starts the Backend Server**: It starts the backend API using the SAM (Serverless Application Model) local start-api command. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Running the Frontend

Once the backend is running, open a new terminal window and start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Local Development Workflow

### Backend Development

The `start-local-backend.sh` script runs the backend server in the foreground. If you make any changes to the lambda functions in the `backend/functions` directory, you will need to stop the script (`Ctrl+C`) and restart it for the changes to take effect.

### Frontend Development

The Next.js development server supports Hot-Module Replacement (HMR). Any changes you make to the frontend code in the `frontend/src` directory will be reflected in your browser automatically.

### Stopping the Environment

To stop the local development environment:

1.  Stop the backend server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `start-local-backend.sh` is running.
2.  Stop the LocalStack container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
    ```

## Environment Details

The `start-local-backend.sh` script will output a summary of the local environment details:

- **LocalStack URL**: `http://localhost:4566`
- **DynamoDB URL**: `http://localhost:4566`
- **S3 URL**: `http://localhost:4566`
- **Admin Username**: `dani`
- **Database Table**: `local-pornspot-media`

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Daemon Not Running

If you get an error message that the Docker daemon is not running, make sure you have started the Docker Desktop application.

### Port Conflicts

If you have other services running on ports `4566` or `3000`, the application might fail to start. Make sure these ports are free before running the setup script.

### Useful Commands

The `start-local-backend.sh` script provides some useful commands for managing the local environment:

- **Restart the infrastructure**: `./scripts/start-local-backend.sh`
- **View LocalStack logs**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f`
- **Stop LocalStack**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down`
- **Check LocalStack health**: `curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health`
